# Logging and error messages

<!-- Static topic. No modifications usually required -->

The interface logs operational messages during interface startup, data collection and recovery. Additional messages are logged if you enable debugging. To view messages, open Windows Event Viewer on the interfaceâ€™s installed machine and go to the Applications and Services Logs. Locate the log using the generic interface name. The management of the logs can be done through the Windows Event Viewer.  

To enable debug output for troubleshooting, launch PI Event Frames Interface Manager, select your interface instance, and go to the Operational Settings tab.

**Log properties**

You can create the Source in the Windows Event Viewer by using the batch interface's source/log name (PIEMDVB) before initially starting the interface. After starting the interface, the Windows Event Viewer creates the Source automatically. 

To change the log path, increase or decrease the maximum size of the log or modify how the log behaves after reaching the defined maximum event log size, open the Windows Event Viewer and locate the source/log name under *Applications and Services Log*. Right-click on the source/log name and select **Properties**.
