<!-- Customized for DeltaV -->

PI Interface for Emerson DeltaV Batch supports **Syncade** Work Flow 4.6 and **Syncade** Work Flow 4.9. The interface supports only one version of Work Flow per instance, unless specifically set using the /WorkFlow46 command line parameter. The interface defaults to **Syncade** Work Flow 4.9.

The interface can capture **Syncade** batches, including manual phase steps (using tag and property templates) from data sources and from **Syncade** web services (historical data) and the Microsoft Message Queue (real-time data).
