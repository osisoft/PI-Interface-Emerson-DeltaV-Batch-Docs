# Release Notes

PI Interface for Emerson DeltaV Batch

**Version 5.1.0.16**

## Overview

PI Interface for Emerson DeltaV captures batch, manufacturing, and process data from an Emerson DeltaV System. The interface collects data from a DeltaV SQL server or EVT files, converts this data to PI tags and PI batch properties, and stores the collected data as event frames and elements within PI Asset Framework (PI AF). You can use tag templates to control PI point creation and event population. All modules, tags, tag aliases, and health tags are automatically created on the PI server.

The 5.1.0.16 release of PI Interface for Emerson DeltaV Batch internally replaces PI SDK with AF SDK - this improves the security, robustness, and communication capabilities of the interface. As a result, this interface only writes Event Frames to a PI AF Server, and disallows creating PI Batches in the PI Batch Database.

Users creating PI Batches in the PI Batch Database need to migrate to Event Frames in order to utilize this version of the interface.

### Fixes

This section lists items that were resolved or added in this release of PI Interface for Emerson Delta V.

| Work Item | Description                                                                     |
| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 22132     | History recovery is fixed to prevent infinite loop scenario when querying for SQL data. In addition, fixed time as double to string time conversions There was a millisecond precision error converting the time stored as doubles to a time string. |
| 22133     | Attribute values referencing other event frames are captured regardless of the order event frames are created. |
| 22140     | Unirecord data sources are now included in unirecord imports and exports. |
| 22153     | Restore DESCRIPT handling in phase step logic. |
| 22156     | Cache start and end times can no longer be permanently altered by arbitration events. |
| 22163     | SQL Native client print message was disabled for Oracle based interfaces. |
| 22171     | Changed the Batch-list management algorithm to improve event processing accuracy (prevent missed batches). | 
| 22172     | When removing an interface from PI Event Frames Interface Manager, it will also remove any associated services. |
| 22181     | When adding an interface to PI Event Frames Interface Manager, the instance ID will be initialized as the same value of interface ID. |
| 22209     | Interface will no longer have a delay in processing a batch when the local time is greater than GMT. |
| 22211     | MONITORTAGWINDOW now defaults to 0, meaning monitor tag counts don't get trimmed to the most recent <MONITORTAGWINDOW> days of activity and roll over at INT_MAX unless MONITORTAGWINDOW is deliberately set. |
| 22216     | Interface ID has been added to the message logs in order to uniquely identify log message.
| 22218     | All generated unirecords will have the placeholder [TIMESTAMP] have the format "YYYY-MM-DD" for a SQL source and "YYYY/MM/DD" for non SQL source like EVT files.
| 22221     | Monitor tags now accurately reflect the number of batches and their child events. |
| 22224     | Bifconfig properly creates new default virtual user service without errors. |
| 22235     | Interface configuration for RST and RET reads UnitedStates format standard. |
| 22245     | The unit procedure batch id attribute is controlled by the unit procedure recipe template batchid. |
| 22246     | BifConfig does not allow older interfaces to edit health tags. |
| 22249     | All batch interfaces remove passwords from INI file regardless of parameter capitalization. |
| 22250     | Merging issue causes unit procedure and operation not to close. |
| 22260     | Batch event frames no longer merge event frames when merging is disabled and unique ids don't match. |
| 22268     | All RST and RET within the configuration will be parsed as US format. Fix in current development branch and in 4.3.x.x Branch. |
| 22275     | A check that verifies that a Procedure Event Frame and a Unit Procedure Event Frame are both generated by the same interface instance before linking them together. |
| 22283     | The Event log source is created during the interface install step. |
| 22464     | For interfaces with a version 5.0.0 or greater, PI Event Frames Interface manager nows tail the windows event viewer instead of PI Message log. |
| 23177     | BifConfig now stores RST and RET as UTC Note that they can be edited in a local friendly time string and read into the interface correctly. When written by the configuration program, they will write the times out as UTC and a local time string as a comment. |
| 23299     | EMDVB fetches SQL data with greater efficiency. EMDVB gathers SQL data for lists of batches rather than querying each batch's data individually, and reuses the same SQL connection for all queries. |
| 24781     | The interface setup kit is using the same GUID for all the interface. This causes trouble when installing another batch interface on the same machine. Fixed to use different GUID for each interface. |
| 24847     | SQL Native Client is no longer supported, and is now replaced with OLEDB for all supported batch interfaces. |
| 25811     | PI data server collectives and PI buffering to multiple PI data servers is now supported. |
| 26756     | With the release of version 5, if you have a batch interface supported batch database, it will no longer be able to write to PIBatch Database. Version 5  only supports Event Frames Customers who need to write to PIBatch. The database needs to stay with Version 4.x.x.x Batch Interfaces. |
| 50935     | Addressed advanced parsing issue when using LBE ("Left Bound Exclusive"). |
| 52120     | Whenever an interface becomes the primary, it will use the /RST command line switch as the start date and process the batches. |
| 67289     | UniRecord exports now include all UniRecord fields. |
| 67298     | Event sorting is faster and memory consumption is better managed during event queuing. |
| 67926     | Interface will not allow Batch events with a zero start time. |
| 68207     | BifConfig will now store SCAN values as low as one second without complaint. |
| 68907     | Default account to setup interface service is now Default Virtual User (NT Service/<Interface Instance Name>). |
| 69287     | Updated the PI Event Frames Interface Manager utility to only allow TagPath properties to be set on Asset Templates and Property Templates. Fixed issue where the TAGPATH value was not being saved properly. |
| 69486     | All attributes are now created on the correct event frame. |
| 69854     | Fixes minor failover issues and includes a health tag that can be used to monitor failover status. |
| 70398     | Float tag values are now evaluated correctly. |
| 70403     | Message logging includes exception data. |
| 72522     | Interface stability improvements. |
| 73489     | Interface no longer hangs due to locale thread lock issue. |
| 73498     | Setup kit creates the event source name under application logs to match with interface application name, which is used by logging framework. |
| 75880     | Procedure level recipe events are processed correctly and have no missing end times. |
| 76997     | Logging added in incomplete data situations such as true batch start not set, no name alias set, unit not set, and matching arbitration event not found. |
| 77832     | Source queries no longer fail when querying over one thousand batches at once. |
